    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by <b>BGB</b>, <time datetime="2012-11-15">November 15, 2012</time></p>

    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>

    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef's table, contact us before <time datetime="2012-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>

    <h3>Location:</h3>
    <p>Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>

    <h3>Hours:</h3>
    <p>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
