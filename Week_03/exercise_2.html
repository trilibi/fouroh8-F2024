        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2012-11-15">November 15, 2012</time></p>

        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</dfn></p>

        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2012-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>

        <p>Location:<br>  Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
        <p>Hours:<br> Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
