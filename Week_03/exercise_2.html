<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
<p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide<i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</i> </p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>

<p>Location: Baker&apos;s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
<p>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight </p>
