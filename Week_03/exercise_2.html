                        This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new
                        cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>.

                                In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food

                                into a water bath that is precisely set to the
                                target temperature of the food. In his book,
                                Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as
                                "ultra-low-temperature poaching".</i
