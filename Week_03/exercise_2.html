    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    posted by BGB, November 15, 2012
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as &quot;ultra-low-temperature poaching&quot;.</em></p>
    
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
