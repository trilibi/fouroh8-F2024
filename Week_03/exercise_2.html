            Low and Slow
        </h2>

        <pre style="font-size: 16px">posted by BGB, November 15, 2012
        
This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff 
Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching".</em>

Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
