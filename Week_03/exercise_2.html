    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <time datetime="2012-11-15">posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</time>
    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. <i>In sous vide  cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</i></p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
    <p>Location:<br />Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
    <p>Hours:<br />Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight </p>
