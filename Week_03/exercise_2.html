        This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".</i>
        <br><br>
        Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
