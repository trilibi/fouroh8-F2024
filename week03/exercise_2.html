            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            posted by BGB, November 15, 2012
            <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide. 
                In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath 
                that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, 
                Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".</i>
            </p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> 
                To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
