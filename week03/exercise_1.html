        <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties.
            My father recommends:
            <p style="text-indent: 45px;">"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to
                blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try
                serving it warm."</p>
