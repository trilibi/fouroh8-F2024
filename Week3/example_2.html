            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>poseted by BGB, <time>November 15, 2012</time></p>
            <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide.</dfn><i> In sous vide cooking you submerge the food (usually vaccum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".</i></p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.</p>
