    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>

      This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous
      vide.
      <i
        ><q
          >In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
          plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target
          temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter
          describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching</q
        >.</i

    </p>

    <p>
      Next month, we will be serving
      <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the
      chef table, contact us before November 30.
