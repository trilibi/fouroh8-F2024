    vide.
    <i

        >In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
        plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target
        temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter
        describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching</q

    Next month, we will be serving
    <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef
    table, contact us before November 30. <br /><br />Location: <br />Baker’s
