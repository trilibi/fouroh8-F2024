        <h3>Low and Slow</h3>
        <p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2012-11-15">November 15, 2012</time></p>
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. <i>In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</i></p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
        <p>Location: <br> Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
        <p>Hours: <br> Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
