        <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

        <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare
           and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:<br>
           "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time
            to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve
            it.  In the winter, try serving it warm."    
        </p>
