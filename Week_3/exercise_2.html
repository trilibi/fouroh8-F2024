            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>

            <p>Posted by BGB: November 15, 2012</p>

            <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide. 
                In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath 
                that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter 
                describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."</em></p>

            <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat 
                at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
            
            <p>Location:</p>
            <p>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
