<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, <time>November 15, 2012</time></p>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. <dfn>In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></dfn></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.</p>

<p>Location:<br>Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
<p>Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
