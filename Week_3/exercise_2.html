<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
posted by BGB, November 15, 2012 <br> <br>

This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
    (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book,
    Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</em> <br> <br>

Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
