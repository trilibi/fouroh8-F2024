        <h3>Low and Slow</h3>

        <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
        <p>This week I am <i>extremely </i>excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide. 
            In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. 
            In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</i></p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
