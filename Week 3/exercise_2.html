            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>posted by BGB, <time>November 15, 2012</time></p>
            <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. <em>In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff<br> Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q> </em></p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>
            <p>Locaiton:<br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
            <p>Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
