<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching. 

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p> 

<p>Location: <br>Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
