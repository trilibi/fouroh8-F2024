            <p><h2>Low and Slow</h2></p>
            <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
            <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</em></p> 
            
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</strong> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
