    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012 </p>

        This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
        </i>

        Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
